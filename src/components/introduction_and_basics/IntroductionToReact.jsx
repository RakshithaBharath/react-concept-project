      <h2>Introduction to React</h2>
      <p>
        React is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It
        was created by Facebook and has gained widespread adoption in the web
        development community due to its simplicity, efficiency, and
        flexibility.
      </p>
      <h3>Key Features of React:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Declarative: React makes it easy to describe how your UI should look
          at any given time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Component-Based: React allows you to build encapsulated components
          that manage their own state.
        </li>
        <li>
          Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI,
          resulting in better performance.
        </li>
        <li>
          Unidirectional Data Flow: React follows a unidirectional data flow
          model, making it easier to reason about data changes.
        </li>
        <li>
          JSX Syntax: React uses JSX, a syntax extension for JavaScript, which
          allows you to write HTML elements in JavaScript code.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Why Learn React?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          React is in high demand: Many companies use React in their tech stack,
          making it a valuable skill for developers.
        </li>
        <li>

          who contribute to its ecosystem.
        </li>
        <li>
