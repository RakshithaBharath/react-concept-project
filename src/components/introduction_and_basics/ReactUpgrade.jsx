      <h2>Upgrading React</h2>
      <p>
        Upgrading React is an essential task to ensure that your projects stay
        up-to-date with the latest features, bug fixes, and security patches.
        Here are some steps to upgrade React in your project:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Check the React release notes to understand the changes and
          improvements introduced in the latest version.
        </li>
        <li>
          Update your project's dependencies to the latest versions of React and
          React-related packages.
          {/* Add installation notes */}
          To install the latest version, from your project folder run the
          following from the terminal:
          <br />
          <code>npm i react@latest react-dom@latest</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          Review your codebase for any deprecated or removed APIs and update
          them to use the recommended alternatives.
        </li>
        <li>
          Run your project's test suite to ensure that the upgrade did not
          introduce any regressions or breaking changes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Test your application thoroughly in different environments to verify
          that it works as expected with the upgraded version of React.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        By following these steps, you can safely upgrade React in your project
        and take advantage of the latest improvements and enhancements.
